# Breast_Cancer_Risk_Factors_Analysis
Machine learning predictive models (Logistic Regression and Boosted Tree) to analyze and visualize the risk factors related to breast cancer. See Jupyter Notebook for details.


Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set
Clinical features were observed or measured for 64 patients with breast cancer and 52 healthy controls. 
Data Set Information:
There are 10 predictors, all quantitative, and a binary dependent variable, indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. The predictors are anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in routine blood analysis. Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer.
Attribute Information:
Age (years), BMI (kg/m2), Glucose (mg/dL), Insulin (µU/mL), HOMA, Leptin (ng/mL), Adiponectin (µg/mL), Resistin (ng/mL), MCP-1(pg/dL), 
Labels: 1=Healthy controls, 2=Patients
